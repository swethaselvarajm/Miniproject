## ANALYSIS OF CRIME AGAINST INDIAN WOMEN BY TIME SERIES AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS 

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The upsurge of crimes against women is one of the top problems confronting each country nowadays. We witness all day long a huge number of cases of assault on women. Analyzing crime trends and significant hidden relationships between crimes can be aided by studying historical crime data. So, it is feasible to simulate a crime prediction model that considers verifiable historical crime information in order to predict future criminal behaviour. Time series research has recently received much more attention. In particular, developing useful and hidden information from trends in multivariate time series has been the focus of this problem in many applied industries such as environmental sciences, agriculture, business and finance.This paper details the implementation of time series algorithm in the prediction of and inference from patterns that repeat frequently across a dataset to derive useful hidden information.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The code successfully analyzes crime data, providing insights into the distribution and prevalence of various crimes against women across states.

The Random Forest model demonstrates high accuracy, showing its potential to predict crime rates based on historical data and influencing factors.

This project provides a solid foundation for deeper analysis, which can be expanded with additional data and features for even more comprehensive insights.
